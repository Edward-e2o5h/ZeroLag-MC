Hello! Welcome to the ZeroLag MC project! A Minecraft optimized for low-end computers.
The project was started in 2025 by me, Edward.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MOD:

1 - How do I start the game?
Simply open the ".bat" or ".exe" file with the mod you want to use.
When you start it, a "Username" section will likely appear—there, enter your nickname and press Enter.

2 - What is OpenGL?
The modifications called "OpenGL" use your processor as a graphics card to run the game.
This is very useful if your graphics card doesn’t support the game or if you don’t have the proper drivers installed.

If the game doesn’t start, try launching it that way.

3 - How do I add more RAM to the JAVA version?
It's currently not possible to add more RAM to version 1.8. To reduce the game’s size, I decided to remove the 64-BIT runtime.

If you want to add more RAM in other versions, right-click the ".BAT" file you use to open the game, and click "Edit".
Then look for the section that says "-XmX" and the amount of RAM in megabytes—change it to the memory you want.
Note: If you have 32-bit, you can't assign more than 1024M.

4 - How can I change my skin in Minecraft JAVA?
By using the "ely.gg" platform. You can find more videos on YouTube for more information.
You can also use a texture pack that allows you to add a skin—search online for more info.

5 - Why doesn’t the game start?
It might not start for several reasons:

Your graphics card drivers are outdated and can’t run the game. Try using "OpenGL" mode.

Your antivirus is blocking the game and may have deleted necessary files. If so, disable it and extract the game again.

Your operating system is too old to support the game, like Windows 2000 or XP.

The file is corrupted and the data is damaged. Try extracting it with 7-Zip and download it using Free Download Manager.

The file is located inside many folders with long names. Try moving the folder to your desktop.

The .BAT script I made doesn’t work well on your PC and gives errors (rare, but possible). In that case, try editing it with ChatGPT to fix the problem.

These are the main causes—there are others, but they are rare.

6 - What are your social networks or contact methods?

7 - Can I upload ZeroLag MC to my website/YouTube channel/etc.?
Yes, as long as you credit the creator Edward and don’t use any kind of link shortener to generate income.
